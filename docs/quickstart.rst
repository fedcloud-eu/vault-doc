User guides
===========

Secret management service is implemented on the base of Hashicorpâ€™s Vault which has web-based GUI and is supported by
many client tools and libraries. However, using Secret management service via FedCloud client is strongly recommended
as the client is tightly integrated with the service, it works out of the box without additional configuration,
has simple syntax and also advanced features like encrypted secrets.

Prerequisite
************

.. highlight:: console

* The latest version of FedCloud client (1.2.18 and higher) is installed. If not, install or upgrade the client:

::

    $ pip3 install -U fedcloudclient

* Valid access token from EGI Check-in for authentication, either from
  `EGI Check-in Token Portal <https://aai.egi.eu/token>`_
  or `oidc-agent <https://indigo-dc.gitbook.io/oidc-agent/>`_, is set to environment variable:

::

    $ export OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN=<ACCESS_TOKEN>

Quickstart
**********

As FedCloud client is tightly integrated with Secret management service, no additional setting is required. Users can
access the service immediately with simple commands:

* Create a secret ``my_app_secrets`` in Secret management service, store MySQL and admin passwords in the secret:

::

    $ fedcloud secret put my_app_secrets mysql_password=123456 admin_password=abcdef

* List secrets stored in Secret management service:

::

    $ fedcloud secret list
    my_app_secrets

* Get a secret from Secret management service. If a key is given, the client will print only the secret value stored
  in the key (useful for scripting), otherwise it will print the table of all key:value pairs.

::

    $ fedcloud secret get my_app_secrets
    key             value
    --------------  -------
    admin_password  abcdef
    mysql_password  123456


    $ fedcloud secret get my_app_secrets mysql_password
    123456

* Delete a secret from Secret management service.

::

    $ fedcloud secret delete my_app_secrets


Secret values from small text files
***********************************

If the value string is started with "@", the FedCloud client will read the content of the file with the name for the
value of the key. The following command creates a secret ``certificate`` in Secret management service for storing
host certificate and its key:

::

    $ fedcloud secret put certificate cert=@hostcert.pem key=@hostkey.pem

Users can get the certificate latter on the target VM as follows:

::

    $ fedcloud secret get certificate cert > hostcert.pem
    $ fedcloud secret get certificate key  > hostkey.pem

So far, only text files are supported. For binary files, it is recommended to use ``uuencode`` command for encoding
the files as texts before uploading and ``uudecode`` for converting the content back to the original format.

The limit of the secret size is 512kB, it is sufficient for storing tokens, certificates, configuration files and
so on. For larger datasets, please use permanent cloud storages.

Encrypted secrets
*****************

For highly-sensitive secrets, users can choose to encrypt the secret values before uploading it to the service. The
encryption is done automatically on the fly if an encryption key (passphrase) is provided:

::

    $ fedcloud secret put certificate cert=@hostcert.pem key=@hostkey.pem --encrypt-key my-pass-phrase

Decryption is done in a similar way, just by providing decryption key, the secret value will be decrypted
automatically if the key is correct:

::

    $ fedcloud secret get certificate cert --decrypt-key my-pass-phrase

Users can verify what is stored in the Vault by reading the secrets without providing decryption key.

::

    $ fedcloud secret get certificate cert
    gAAAAAB...............................

The encryption is done by standard Python crytography library. Security experts are invited to review the code
(available at `GitHub <https://github.com/tdviet/fedcloudclient/blob/master/fedcloudclient/secret.py#L124>`_)
and give feedback and suggestions for improvements if possible.

Export and import secrets
*************************

Users can print secrets to files YAML/JSON format for further processing by option ``--output-format`` or simply ``-f``:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ fedcloud secret get my_app_secrets -f json

    $ fedcloud secret get my_app_secrets -f yaml > my_app_secrets.yaml

The secrets in YAML/JSON files can be imported back to the service by adding "@" before filenames as parameters,
telling client to read secrets from files:

::

    $ fedcloud secret put my_second_app_secrets @my_app_secrets.yaml


Note the difference in examples: ``cert=@hostcert.pem`` for reading the content of the file ``horstcert.pem`` as the
value for the key ``cert``, and ``@my_app_secrets.yaml`` for reading whole key:value pairs from the YAML file.

As YAML format is simpler, it is expected by default unless the filename has ``.json`` extension. Try to export your
secrets to both formats to see the differences between formats.

Importing secrets in files in free text format "key=value" is not supported as the format is error-prone, especially
for multi-line secret values or values with special characters. Users can replace ``=`` to ``:`` for converting simple
free text files to YAML format. Note that a blank space after ``:`` is required by YAML syntax.
