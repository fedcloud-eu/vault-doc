Introduction
============

Applications in EGI Infrastructure may need different secrets (credentials, tokens, passwords, etc.) during deployments
and operations. The secrets are often stored as clear texts in configuration files or code repositories that expose
security risks. Furthermore, the secrets stored in files are static and difficult to change/rotate. The secret
management service for EGI Infrastructure is developed to solve the issues.

The Secret management service is designed as follows:

* Simple usage: A dedicated module of FedCloud client is developed to make the service works out of the box with very
  simple syntax. Authentication is realized via OIDC tokens from EGI Check-in, no additional registration,
  no extra credentials are required.

* Compatibility: The service is based on Hashicorpâ€™s Vault which is well-known in industry, with many client tools
  and libraries. Software for service and clients are open-sourced with strong support from communities.

* High-availability: Service instances are distributed on different sites, without single point of failure. A generic
  endpoint https://vault.services.fedcloud.eu:8200 is dynamically assigned
  to a healthy instance via Dynamic DNS service.
