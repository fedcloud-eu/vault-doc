Introduction
============

Applications in EGI Infrastructure may need different secrets (credentials, tokens, passwords, etc.) during deployments
and operations. The secrets are often stored as clear texts in configuration files or code repositories that expose
security risks. Furthermore, the secrets stored in files are static and difficult to change/rotate. The secret
management service for EGI Infrastructure is developed to solve the issues.

The Secret management service is designed as follows:

* **Usability**: A dedicated module of `FedCloud client <https://fedcloudclient.fedcloud.eu/>`_ is developed to
  make the service works out of the box with very
  simple syntax. Authentication is realized via OIDC tokens from EGI Check-in, no additional registration,
  no extra credentials are required.

* **Advanced features**: Built-in support for secret values from files, export/import secrets to/from files in
  YAML/JSON formats. Encrypting/decrypting secret values on the fly on the client side greatly improves security
  and trust of the service.

* **Compatibility**: The service is based on `Hashicorpâ€™s Vault <https://www.vaultproject.io/>`_
  which is well-known in industry, with many client tools
  and libraries. Software for service and clients are open-sourced with strong support from communities.

* **High-availability**: Service instances are distributed on different sites, without single point of failure.
  A generic endpoint https://vault.services.fedcloud.eu:8200 is dynamically assigned
  to a healthy instance via Dynamic DNS service.
